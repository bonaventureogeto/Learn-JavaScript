/**
    Challenge: Fibonacci Sequence
        Create a function called fibonacci_sequence that takes in an integer n as its parameter 
        and returns a list of the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
        The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is 
        the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence starts with 0 and 1, 
        and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.
        Example input/output:
        fibonacci_sequence(5) => [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]
        fibonacci_sequence(10) => [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
        Hint: You can use a recursive function to generate the sequence,
        and utilize the concept of function scope to keep track of the previous two numbers.

function fibonacci(number) {
    let fib = [0, 1]; // Initialize array!

    for (let i = 2; i < number; i++) {
      fib[i] = fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2]; // fib[2] + fib[1] , [0, 1, 1, 2]
    }
    console.log(fib);

}

fibonacci(10) // [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
