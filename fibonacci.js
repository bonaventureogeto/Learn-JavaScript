/**
    Challenge: Fibonacci Sequence
        Create a function called fibonacci_sequence that takes in an integer n as its parameter 
        and returns a list of the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
        The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is 
        the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence starts with 0 and 1, 
        and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.
        Example input/output:
        fibonacci_sequence(5) => [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]
        fibonacci_sequence(10) => [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
        Hint: You can use a recursive function to generate the sequence,
        and utilize the concept of function scope to keep track of the previous two numbers.

fibonacci(11) // [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]
